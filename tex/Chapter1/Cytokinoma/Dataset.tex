\subsection[Dataset]{Dataset}\label{cytokine_data}

In this case-control observational study, we evaluated $289$ old-age subjects referred to our Geriatric Memory Clinic.
The dataset comprises $189$ female and $100$ male individuals with a mean age of $78.6$ ($\pm7.5$) years.
The date were provided by the co-authors of this project at the Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics at the University of Perugia (Department of Medicine).
For each patient a set of 26 cytokine expression level were computed with the additional informations about subject set, age and diagnosis label (AD, MCI or CTL).
Of the 289 enrolled subjects, the whole set of cytokines was available for 284 subjects (98\%), specifically 87/88 CTL (99\%), 70/73 MCI (96\%), 127/129 AD (98\%).

Firstly we applied the DNetPRO algorithm looking for a signature capable of discriminating between CTL and AD: to this purpose, we performed a Hold-Out cross-validation procedure to identify the cytokine signature, considering 2/3 of samples to train the model and then we tested the signature performance on the remaining 1/3 of the total samples.
In this analysis we did not separate male from female samples, to avoid the bias given by the uneven number of samples in these two groups, and since previous analysis at a single-cytokine level did not find significant differences due to sex.
Then, we classified MCI samples with the CTL-AD signature obtained in the previous step,  that allowed labeling MCI samples as CTL or non-CTL.
