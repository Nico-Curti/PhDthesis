\section[Benchmark]{Benchmark of DNetPRO algorithm}\label{synapse:benchmark}

Up to now we have been talked about the DNetPRO algorithm from a theoretical point-of-view.
Starting from this section we discuss about the application of the algorithm on real biological datasets (see Appendix B - Venice Road Network for results obtained on a different kind of data).

Despite previous version of the DNetPRO method were already applied on biological data~\cite{PMrna, Scotlandi2009, PMgene, Terragna} a wide range benchmark of it was still missing.
In the following sections we describe the results obtained on the Synapse dataset and published in~\cite{Curti2019}.
