\section[Benchmark]{Benchmark of DNetPRO algorithm}\label{synapse:benchmark}

Up to now we have been talked about the \textsf{DNetPRO} algorithm from a theoretical and numerical points-of-view.
Starting from this section, we discuss about the application of this algorithm on real biological datasets (see Appendix B - Venice Road Network for results obtained on non-biological data types).

Previous versions of the \textsf{DNetPRO} algorithm have been already applied on biological data~\cite{PMrna, Scotlandi2009, PMgene, Terragna}, but in this work we want to introduce a wide range benchmark of it.
In the following sections we are going to describe the results obtained on the Synapse dataset and published in~\cite{Curti2019}.
