## Benchmark of DNetPRO algorithm

Up to now we have been talked about the DNetPRO algorithm from a theoretical point-of-view.
Starting from this section, we discuss about the application of the algorithm on real biological datasets (see Appendix B - Venice Road Network for results obtained on a different kind of data).

Despite of previous version of the DNetPRO method were already applied on biological data [[PMrna](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2013/10/02/gr.155192.113.abstract), [Scotlandi2009](https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2008.19.2542), [PMgene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26297486), [Terragna](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26575327)], a wide range benchmark of it was still missing.
In the following sections we describe the results obtained on the Synapse dataset and published in [[Curti2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/09/19/773622)].
