## Benchmark of `DNetPRO` algorithm

Up to now we have been talked about the `DNetPRO` algorithm from a theoretical and numerical points-of-view.
Starting from this section, we discuss about the application of this algorithm on real biological datasets (see [Appendix B - Venice Road Network](../../Appendix/Venice/README.md) for results obtained on non-biological data types).

Previous versions of the `DNetPRO` algorithm have been already applied on biological data [[PMrna](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2013/10/02/gr.155192.113.abstract), [Scotlandi2009](https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2008.19.2542), [PMgene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26297486), [Terragna](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26575327)], but in this work we want to introduce a wide range benchmark of it.
In the following sections we are going to describe the results obtained on the Synapse dataset and published in [[Curti2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/09/19/773622)].
