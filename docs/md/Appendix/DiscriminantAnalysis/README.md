## Discriminant Analysis

The classification problems aim to associate a set of *pattern* to one or more *classes*.
With *pattern* we identify a multidimensional array of data labeled by a pre-determined tag.
In this case we talk about *supervised learning*, i.e the full set of data is already annotated and we have prior knowledge about the association between data and classes.

In machine learning a key rule is played by Bayesian methods, i.e methods which use a Bayesian statistical approach to the analysis of data distributions.
It can be proved that, if the underlying distributions are known, i.e a sufficient number of its moments are known with a sufficient precision, the Bayesian approach is the best possible method to face the classification problem ([*Bayesian error rate*](https://doc.lagout.org/science/Artificial%20Intelligence/Pattern%20recognition/Introduction%20to%20Statistical%20Pattern%20Recognition%202nd%20Ed%20-%20%20Keinosuke%20Fukunaga.pdf)).
