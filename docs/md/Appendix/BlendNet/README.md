Graph visualization is still an open problem in many applications.
The problem is commonly related to large graph visualization in which problems arise from the rendering of a large number of nodes and a greater number of links between them (a graph with `N` nodes could have `(N x N)` possible links).
An other open problem concern the multi-dimensional visualization of graphs.
Despite common graph tools compute the node coordinates in any space dimensions (and clearly the maximum number of possible dimension for a visualization is only 3) the real visualization is often allowed only in 2D spaces.
The counterpart of these problems concern a pretty visualization of the graphs that it is often ignored by many tools which prefer focusing on simple renderings.

In this section we introduce a new custom graph viewer developed for pretty small-network visualization in 2D and 3D, called [`BlendNet`](https://github.com/Nico-Curti/BlendNet) (*Blender Network viewer*).
`BlendNet` is an open-source project and it is released on Github under GPL license.
All the small-graphs showed in this work are made using this tool and in particular the feature-signatures generated by the `DNetPRO` algorithm.

`BlendNet` is written in `Python` with the help of `Blender` API.
`Blender` is now a standard for 3D rendering and it is commonly used in a wide range of graphical applications, starting from the simpler 3D dynamics to video-game applications.
`Blender` is certainly more than a simple graphical viewer but it provide an easy `Python` interface and a wide on-line documentation which make it a useful tool for graphical representation of 3D structures.

We are forced to use the `Python` version provided by `Blender` to use its APIs and any extra-package required by our application have to be installed with the appropriated `pip`.
We use the `networkx` `Python` library for node coordinates computation and thus we have to update our `Python`-`Blender` with the appropriated packages.
Moreover, since the code can be difficult to manage for non-expert users we have written an easy command-line interface to set the whole set of parameters required by the graph viewer that can be piloted via [`Makefile`](https://github.com/Nico-Curti/BlendNet/blob/master/Makefile) rules.
The list of nodes and edges can be passed via command-line with relative filenames, in the same format of the concurrent graph viewers (e.g *Gephi* software, the other graph viewer used in this work to generate the larger network structures of the `CHIMeRA` project).

The software project is a single script file and it includes a full list of possible [examples](https://github.com/Nico-Curti/BlendNet/blob/master/example) and usages.
Some of this examples are shown in the initial [Figure](../../../../img/cycle_graph.png).
A full list of installation instructions is also provided for any operative system ([Unix, MacOS](https://github.com/Nico-Curti/BlendNet/blob/master/install.sh) and [Windows](https://github.com/Nico-Curti/BlendNet/blob/master/install.ps1)).
These instructions cover a full installation of `Blender`, `Python` and `BlendNet` package for administrator and no-root users [[`Shut`](https://github.com/Nico-Curti/Shut)].
With slight code editing we can obtain different node coordinates and shapes.
Node colors, sizes and positions can also be given using the node-list file as independent columns.
